## Architecture
I used the 3-tier architecture because it was recommended by Google and because it is widely utilized in applications.

## Libraries

The libraries I used that are not standard Android ones were:

Koin: I chose it for its simplicity in configuration.
Retrofit: The most commonly used library for HTTP requests on Android.
Coil: A library for image loading on Android, supported by Kotlin Coroutines.
